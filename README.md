# Hands On Data Mining y Machine Learning 2023-A

This repository contains a set of exercises for our course ICCD623 Data Mining and Machine Learning 2023-A.

The exercises are designed to reinforce the concepts and techniques learned during the course and provide hands-on practice in Python and R.

Students are required to be profficient in both programming languages.

## Introduction

Exercises are designed to provide hands-on experience and reinforce the theoretical concepts discussed in the course. Each exercise aims at providing practice and improve students' skills in implementing machine learning algorithms and analyzing real-world datasets.

## Prerequisites

To work with the exercises in this repository, it is recommended to attend classes in order to have a good understanding of data analysis, as well as strong competence in programming concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
    |-- data
    |   |-- 01_datamanip
    |   |   |-- Index
    |   |   |-- echocardiogram.data
    |   |   |-- echocardiogram.names 
    |   |-- 02_dataq
    |   |-- ...
    |
    |-- notebooks
    |   |-- 01_DataManip.ipynb
    |   |-- 02_DataQuality.ipynb
    |   |-- ...
    |
    |-- LICENSE
    |-- README.md
    |-- main.py
    |-- requirements.txt
```

The data directory contains datasets used for our exercises.

The notebooks directory contains the set of Jupyter Notebook files (.ipynb) that solve our Python-based and R-based exercises.

The README.md file provides an overview of the repository and instructions for usage.

The requirements.txt file provides the set of libraries required for both Python and R exercises.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ivan-carrera/handson_2023A.git
```

2. Navigate to the exercise directory (notebooks).

3. Open the exercise file (.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or an integrated development environment (IDE) of your choice.

4. Read the exercise description, follow the instructions, and implement the required code or complete the given tasks.

5. Experiment with different approaches and modify the code as needed to deepen your understanding of the concepts.

6. Use the provided sample solutions as a reference to validate your answers and compare your implementation.

7. Repeat the process for other exercises in the repository to further enhance your skills in Data Mining and Machine Learning.
